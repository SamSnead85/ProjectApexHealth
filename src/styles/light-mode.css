   APEX LIGHT MODE
   
   Light mode is now the DEFAULT theme (see :root in index.css).
   - Page backgrounds: #F3F5F8
   - Card backgrounds: #FFFFFF
   - Text: #111827 (primary), #4B5563 (secondary)
   - Accent: #2563EB (blue)
   - Sidebar: dark navy (#1B2332)
   
   The [data-theme="light"] component overrides live in index.css
   (LIGHT THEME COMPONENT OVERRIDES section).
   
   This file previously contained a "Warm Aurora" alternate design
   that used cream/ivory backgrounds and teal/coral accents, which
   no longer matches the clinical design system. It has been cleaned
   out to prevent conflicts with the default light theme.
   
   If component-specific light-mode tweaks are needed beyond what
   index.css provides, add them below.
